            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <lic class="olist">
                    Slice the beef against the grain into slices. 
                    Transfer to a small bowl. Add soy sauce, peanut oil, 
                    and cornstarch. Gently mix well by hand 
                    until all the slices are coated with a thin layer of sauce. 
                    Marinate for 10 minutes while preparing the other ingredients.
                </li>
                <lic class="olist">
                    Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a medium-sized bowl. Mix well.
                </li>
                <li class="olist">
                    Add 1/4 cup water into a large nonstick skillet over 
                    medium-high heat until the water begins to boil. 
                    Add the broccoli and cover. Steam until the broccoli 
                    just turns tender and the water evaporates,1 minute or so. 
                    Transfer broccoli to a plate. Wipe the pan with a paper towel 
                    held in a pair of tongs if thereâ€™s any water left.
                </li>
                <li class="olist">
                    Add the oil and swirl to coat the bottom. 
                    Spread the steak in a single layer. Allow to cook 
                    without touching for 30 seconds, or until the bottom 
                    side is browned. Flip to cook the other side for a few seconds. 
                    Stir and cook until the surface is lightly charred and the inside 
                    is still pink.
                </li>
                <li class="olist">
                    Add the garlic and ginger. 
                    Stir a few times to release the flavor and fragrance.
                </li>
                <li class="olist">
                    Return the broccoli to the pan. 
                    Stir the sauce again to dissolve the cornstarch completely 
                    and pour it into the skillet. Cook and stir until the sauce thickens, 
                    about 1 minute. Transfer everything to a plate immediately. 
                    Serve hot as a main dish.
